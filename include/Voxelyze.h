//! Defines and simulates a configuration of voxels.
/*!
The primary user-accesible concepts of Voxelyze are materials, voxels, and links.

Materials represent an abstract material with physical properties and must be added via one of the addMaterial() functions before any voxels may be added. Materials hold no state - they are essentially just a container for a set of material properties.

Voxels are added using setVoxel() and use a previously added material. Voxels always begin as cubes on a regular lattice - therefore only x, y, and z indices are need to fully specify where to add a voxel. A voxel object may have an "external" influence (such as being fixed to ground in one or more degrees of freedom, or an external force applied) which is accessed through its external() member function. A voxel also contains state information such as its current position and velocity.

Links are never added directly. Instead whenenver a voxel is added a link is automatically created to any adjacent voxels. Links hold all the structural information of the simulated Euler-Bernoulli beam connecting two adjacent voxels. In the case of two voxels with dissimilar materials, the link object automatically calculates the appropriate composite material properties. Links hold state information such as stress, strain, and strain energy. 

The pointers returned for materials, voxels, and links are valid for the entire lifetime of that particular material, voxel, or link. It is also possible to iterate over all materials, voxels, or links using, for example, materialCount() and material().

Once the desired voxels are set up, the simulation is run by simply calling doTimeStep() repeatedly until the desired result is acheived. Because Voxelyze utilizes numerical integration, too large of a timestep will cause divergent instability. This depends on many things, most notably the stiffness and density of voxels in use. Heavy, stiff voxels will be stable for larger timesteps. Calling doTimeStep() without an argument will use a good estimation of the larger stable timestep duration. This timestep is used synchronously for all voxels, so the entire simulation will run at the slowest timestep (as determined usually by the stiffest/lightest material in use).

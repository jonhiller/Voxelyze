//!Defines a solid link between two adjacent voxels and holds its current state
/*!A CVX_Link calculates the force and moments between two voxels given their relative positions and orientations.

A 12 degree of freedom beam element is utilized to physically model the connection. Pure tension/compression, pure torsion, and slender beam equations are used. Small angle approximations are applied in appropriate scenarios to accelerate computation.

The force and moment for either voxel can be queried, as well as the current axial stress and strain of the link. If voxels are changing size (under thermal or other actuation) then updateRestLength() must be called every timestep. Likewise if the poissons ratio of either voxel is non-zero updateTransverseInfo() must be called likewise.

Information pertaining to one voxel or the other is indicated by the boolean parameter "positiveEnd". If positiveEnd is true, information will be returned for the voxel with the most positive coordinate in the original (undeformed) lattice.

//quaternion properties (for reference)
//1) To rotate a vector V, form a quaternion with w = 0; To rotate by Quaternion Q, do Q*V*Q.Conjugate() and trim off the w component.
//2) To do multiple rotations: To Rotate by Q1 THEN Q2, Q2*Q1*V*Q1.Conjugate*Q2.Conjugate(), or make a Qtot = Q2*Q1 and do Qtot*V*Qtot.Conjugate()
//3) Q1*Q1.Conjugate - Identity
//4) To do a reverse rotation Q1, just do Q1.conjugate*V*Q1
//5) An orientation quaternion is really just the relative rotation from the identity quaternion (1,0,0,0) to this orientation.
//6) If an orientation is represented by Q1, to rotate that orientation by Q2 the new orientation is Q2*Q1

To ease computation, the quantities constant to a voxel have been factored out and are returned by the voxel's dampingMultiplier() function.
These quantites are zeta, 2, sqrt(m), and dt.
Therefore each sqrt(mk) (or equivalent term) has been pre-calculated with sqrt(m) factored out.
For example of a1 term, (and easy extension to b1's), velocity = dPos2.x/dt and k = a1.
Continuing example, factoring out everything constant per voxel we have (-zeta*s*sqrt(m)/dt) * (sqrt(a1)*dPos2.x).
The former quantity is returned by the voxel's dampingMultiplier() function. The latter quantity (for all) is precomputed without the positions and angles of course)

STRAIN ENERGY of the bond is the area under the force-displacement curve that can be recovered.

PURE TENSION AND COMPRESSION:
For our purposes, even with non-linear materials, it is assumed materials will rebound with their base elastic modulus.

Strain energy is the shaded area, slope is EA/L, therefore bottom edge length is FL/AE.
Area is then Fcurrent*(FL/AE)/2. (or, given EA/L is stiffness k, strain energy = 0.5*F^2/k (or F^2/(2k))

PURE TORSION
For rotational, the process is similar: T^2/(2k) where K is units of N-m

BENDING
The strain energy from bending = integral [M(x)^2 dx / (2EI)].
Because we only load the ends of the beam, M(x) = (M2-M1)*x/L+M1 (Linear interoplation, M1 and M2 are the moments at each end).
Plugging and chugging though the integral, we get:

Strain energy = L/(6EI) * (M1^2 + M1*M2 + M2^2)

Note that the sign of M2 must be reversed from that calculated by the stiffness matrix.
This is because a positive "Moment" on a beam (in the moment diagram) is actually two opposite-direction torques on the ends of the beam. ALA http://www.efunda.com/formulae/solid_mechanics/beams/sign_convention.cfm

This means Strain energy = L/(6EI) * (M1^2 - M1*M2' + M2'^2)

SHEAR
Not currently modeled in voxcad.

SUPERPOSITION:
We assume each of these modes is independent, thus total strain energy is simply the sum of them all.

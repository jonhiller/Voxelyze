//!Defines a specific instance of a voxel and holds its current state.
/*!The voxel class contains all information about a voxel's physical characteristics, state, and CVX_Link's to other adjacent voxels.

A voxel needs a CVX_MaterialVoxel to be created and define its physical properties. Later, these can be accessed by material().

A voxel can have external forced or prescribed displacements applied by accessing its CVX_External object using the external() function. To save memory allocation the CVX_External object is not created until the first time external() is called. Use externalExists() to determine if this voxel has any externals applied.

The state of the voxel includes it position(), size(), orientation(), velocity(), etc.

A voxel has a local coordinate system (LCS) that always stays centered on the center of the voxel and oriented with the axes of the cube. The global coordinate system (GCS) is just that - the global coordinate system.
